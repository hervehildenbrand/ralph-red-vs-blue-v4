This forced all DC-side traffic through longer paths.\n\n### Targeted Fix Applied\nOnly P3 Et3 was fixed (16777214 → 10). Other elevated metrics were left as they weren't causing the problem and may be intentional.\n\n### Final Verification\n| VRF | Status | Packet Loss | Notes |\n|-----|--------|-------------|-------|\n| ALPHA | ✅ OPERATIONAL | 0% | |\n| BETA | ✅ OPERATIONAL | 0% | |\n| GAMMA | ✅ OPERATIONAL | 0% | RTT improved ~0.3ms |\n\nEXIT_SIGNAL: true","session_id":"d06cdaf8-ca6c-4428-98c0-d5051828aa77","total_cost_usd":1.7548275000000007,"usage":{"input_tokens":14,"cache_creation_input_tokens":130724,"cache_read_input_tokens":1619577,"output_tokens":3619,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":130724}},"modelUsage":{"claude-haiku-4-5-20251001":{"inputTokens":35289,"outputTokens":436,"cacheReadInputTokens":0,"cacheCreationInputTokens":0,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":0.037469,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":64000},"claude-opus-4-5-20251101":{"inputTokens":14,"outputTokens":3619,"cacheReadInputTokens":1619577,"cacheCreationInputTokens":130724,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":1.7173585,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":64000}},"permission_denials":[],"uuid":"6f2156d3-d937-44b6-bb88-7739e9cb812f"}
