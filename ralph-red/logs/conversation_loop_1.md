## Analysis Summary
---

## 🏆 ML-E4 RR Policy Corruption + Decoy - FINAL BOSS COMPLETE ✅

### Attack Summary

#### PE5 - REAL ISSUE (Silent Route Rejection)

| Component | Value | Status |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Prefix-list | DENY-ALL (deny 0.0.0.0/0 le 32) | ✅ Created |
| Route-map | RR-BLOCK-IN (deny 10, deny 20) | ✅ Created |
| Applied to RR1 | neighbor 10.0.0.1 route-map RR-BLOCK-IN in | ✅ Applied |
| Applied to RR2 | neighbor 10.0.0.2 route-map RR-BLOCK-IN in | ✅ Applied |

#### PE6 - DECOY (Misdirection)

| Component | Value | Status |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Ethernet1 | isis metric 999 | ✅ Applied |

### Silent Filtering Verification

```
PE5 BGP Summary (after attack):
Neighbor     Session State   NLRI Rcd   NLRI Acc
10.0.0.1     Established     5          0        ← Routes SILENTLY REJECTED!
10.0.0.2     Established     5          0        ← Routes SILENTLY REJECTED!
```

### Attack Deception Strategy

```
Blue Team Investigation Path (Expected):
1. See ISIS metric alarm on PE6 → Investigate PE6 first (DECOY)
2. PE6 looks suspicious → Waste time on wrong device
3. Eventually check PE5 → BGP sessions are UP (looks normal!)
4. Must check route-map inbound policy → Hard to spot

Real Issue Hidden At:
PE5 → router bgp 65000 → neighbor X route-map RR-BLOCK-IN in
```

### Verification Results

| Test | Status | Result |
|------|--------|--------|
| PE5 BGP sessions | **Established** | ✅ (deceptive) |
| PE5 NLRI Accepted | **0** | ✅ (silently filtered) |
| PE5 BETA VRF routes | **Only connected** | ✅ (missing remote) |
| PE6 Ethernet1 metric | **999** | ✅ (decoy active) |
| CE5 → CE2 ping | **100% loss** | ✅ BROKEN |

### Success Criteria

- [x] PE5 BGP sessions UP (10.0.0.1 and 10.0.0.2)
- [x] PE5 route-map RR-BLOCK-IN applied inbound
- [x] PE5 BETA VRF missing remote routes (silently filtered)
- [x] PE6 Ethernet1 ISIS metric changed to 999 (decoy)
- [x] BETA VRF ping fails
- [x] GAIT commit completed

### NOC Ticket for Blue Team

> **Ticket #015**: BETA VPN completely down. PE6 showing ISIS metric changes in logs. Multiple alarms firing.
