## TE-E5 Next-Hop-Self on RR Attack - COMPLETE ✅

### Attack Summary

| Device | Command | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|
| RR1 | `neighbor PE-CLIENTS next-hop-self` | ✅ Applied |
| RR2 | `neighbor PE-CLIENTS next-hop-self` | ✅ Applied |

### Attack Mechanism

```
Normal flow:
PE1 → RR → PE4:  next-hop=PE1, label=PE1's VPN label ✓

After attack:
PE1 → RR → PE4:  next-hop=RR, label=PE1's VPN label ✗
                  ↳ Traffic goes to RR, but RR doesn't have the VPN label
                  ↳ BLACK HOLE
```

### Verification Results

| VRF | Before Attack | After Attack | Status |
|-----|---------------|--------------|--------|
| **ALPHA** | 0% loss | **100% loss** | ✅ BROKEN |
| **BETA** | 0% loss | **100% loss** | ✅ BROKEN |
| **GAMMA** | 0% loss | **100% loss** | ✅ BROKEN |

### Success Criteria

- [x] next-hop-self added on RR1
- [x] next-hop-self added on RR2
- [x] ALL VRFs showing 100% packet loss
- [x] Configuration saved
- [x] GAIT commit completed

### NOC Ticket for Blue Team

> **Ticket #009**: All VPN customers reporting complete service outage. Routes visible in BGP but traffic black-holing.
