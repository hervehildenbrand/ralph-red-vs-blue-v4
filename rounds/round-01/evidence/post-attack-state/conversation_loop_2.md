## Analysis Summary
The output shows:
- **ISIS on Ethernet1**: Only `isis network point-to-point` remains - `isis enable CORE` was removed ✅
- **Segment Routing**: No output - SR was removed ✅  
- **BGP send-community**: No output for extended - removed ✅

All 3 attack components are still in effect.

| 2 | ISIS CORE | `no segment-routing mpls` | ✅ Applied |
| 3 | BGP 65000 | `no neighbor RR send-community extended` | ✅ Applied |

### Verification Results

| VRF | Status | Packet Loss |
|-----|--------|-------------|
| **GAMMA** | **BROKEN** | 100% ✅ |

### Success Criteria
