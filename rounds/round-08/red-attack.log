## ML-E5 Cross-VRF Route Leak Attack - COMPLETE ✅

### Attack Summary

| Component | Before | After | Status |
|-----------|--------|-------|--------|
| ALPHA RT export | 65000:100 | 65000:100 + **65000:200** | ✅ Added |

### Route Leak Verification

```
PE2 BETA VRF routing table:
B I      192.168.1.0/24 [200/0]   ← ALPHA route leaked into BETA!
```

### Success Criteria

- [x] RT 65000:200 added to ALPHA export on PE1
- [x] ALPHA routes leaking into BETA VRF (192.168.1.0/24 visible)
- [x] Configuration saved
- [x] GAIT commit completed

### NOC Ticket for Blue Team

> **Ticket #008**: BETA customer seeing unexpected routes, possible route leak.
