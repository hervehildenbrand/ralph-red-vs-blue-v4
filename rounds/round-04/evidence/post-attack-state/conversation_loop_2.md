07b569f attack: SR-E2 SRGB Mismatch on P3
```

## Analysis Summary
ALPHA VRF is completely down - there may be additional issues from other attacks. The MTU attack is still in place regardless.

---

## INT-E4 MTU Black Hole Attack - VERIFIED ACTIVE ✅

### Attack Status

| Component | Before | After | Status |
|-----------|--------|-------|--------|
| P2 Ethernet3 MTU | 1500 | **1400** | ✅ Reduced |

### Verification

```
IP MTU 1400 bytes, BW 1000000 kbit
```

### Success Criteria

- [x] MTU reduced to 1400 on P2 Ethernet3
- [x] Configuration saved (persisted from previous session)

**Note:** Current full connectivity loss on ALPHA VRF may be due to cumulative effects of multiple attacks (SR-E2 SRGB mismatch on P3 + this MTU black hole).

### NOC Ticket for Blue Team

> **Ticket #004**: Customer reports large file transfers fail but email and web browsing work fine.
